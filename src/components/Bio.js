      <p>Hi, nice to meet you! My name is Noah and I am a web developer. I have always been fascinated by technology and computers. In high school and college I took introductory courses for computer science and knew that I had found my calling. I received certification for full stack web development through the University of Minnesota. Besides coding, my interests include movies, video games, basketball, hanging out with dogs, and reading history books.</p>
